function p = dijkstra(A,source,target)
% Private function to digraph

%DIJKSTRA Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path.
% P = DIJKSTRA(A,SOURCE,TARGET) for sparse boolean Adjacency Matrix A and
% indices SOURCE and TARGET, returns the indexed shortest path P.
%
% P is empty if there is no path from SOURCE to TARGET, or in the trivial
% case that SOURCE == TARGET.
% If P is not empty, then P(1) == SOURCE.

% See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm
